## Description
SimplyOrganize is a simple yet powerful calendar application with just the exact features to organize yourself. It runs on NodeJS with Next.js as frontend, Next.js API Routes as backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the database.

### Motivation
I like to use a virtual calendar for organizing myself. However, none which I have tested convinced me. Many times, you have to pay to use them or they are based on events, which makes it annonying to manage other types of tasks.

With SimplyOrganize, I expect to create a solution for such problem by providing a simple alternative. It is based on descriptions rather than events, and its features are easy to navigate and use.

### Quickstart
- Install NodeJS and NPM.
- Download the source code.
- Create a file called `.env.local` on the project's root and add your MongoDB's database username, password and host (See `.envlocal.example` for an example).
- Go to the root directory of the project and run `npm install`.
- Run the following command on your terminal: `npm run dev`.
- Go to `localhost:3000` (or your default NextJS port) and you will see the application running!

### Platforms
This project was tested in Firefox, on both Windows and Linux.

In Windows you may need to install WSL2 to run the Bash script in the `scripts/` folder.
