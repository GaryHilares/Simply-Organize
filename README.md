# SimplyOrganize
#### Video Demo created for CS50x: https://youtu.be/b26DFdzpijE
## Description
SimplyOrganize is a simple yet powerful calendar application with just the exact features to organize yourself. It runs on NodeJS with Next.js as frontend, Next.js API Routes as backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the database.

### Motivation
I like to use a virtual calendar for organizing myself. However, many times, they are paid or based on events, which makes it annonying for me to manage other types of tasks.

With SimplyOrganize, I expect to create a solution for such problem by providing a simple alternative. It is based on descriptions rather than events, and its features are easy to navigate and use.

### Quickstart
- Install NodeJS and NPM.
- Download the source code.
- Go to the root directory of the project and run `npm install`.
- Run the following command on your terminal: `npm run dev`.
- Go to `localhost:3000` (or your default NextJS port) and you will see the application running!

### Platforms
This project was tested in Firefox, on both Windows and Linux.

In Windows you may need to install WSL2 to run the Bash script in the `scripts/` folder.
